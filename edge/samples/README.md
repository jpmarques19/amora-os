# Sample Music Files

This directory contains sample files for testing the Waybox Player in development mode.

In a real deployment, this directory would contain actual MP3 files. For testing purposes, we're using text files as placeholders.

## Structure

- `sample1.txt`, `sample2.txt`: Sample music files (simulated)
- `playlists/`: Directory containing playlists

## Adding Real MP3 Files

To test with real audio, add MP3 files to this directory and update the playlists accordingly.
